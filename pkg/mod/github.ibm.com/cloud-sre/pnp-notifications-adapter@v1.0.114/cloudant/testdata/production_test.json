It’s the normal transition that follows our contribution of OpenWhisk technology to The Apache Software Foundation. OpenWhisk is now exclusively known as “Apache OpenWhisk,” and IBM is a member of the growing open source community developing this popular open source, serverless, cloud software project. As IBM Cloud Functions evolves, our cloud users will continue to benefit from the innovations that are contributed by the broader open source community.

It only supports applications that are pushed with the IBM Liberty for Java or IBM SDK for Node.js buildpacks.\n<br><br>\n<b>Why deprecate RMU?</b><br>\nThe current design of RMU is based on the Cloud Foundry DEA architecture. Also, the RMU client and server provide a management channel over HTTP so that dump and trace can be done without the SSH capability. IBM Cloud Foundry has fully migrated to the Diego architecture, which has SSH enabled. Most of the functions that RMU now provides can be done by simply using SSH to connect into the application instance container and examine the runtime directly.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is the replacement solution?</b><br>\nThe replacement solution leverages the SSH capability in the Cloud Foundry Diego architecture to log into the application container. It is done by using the cf command line ‘cf ssh’, for generating dump and change trace/log settings. The solution is documented in the  <u><a href=\"https://console.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/liberty/loggingAndTracing.html#using_trace_and_dump\" target=\"_blank\">Configure logging and tracing</a></u> section of the platform documentation.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note</b>: The replacement solution does not provide the following functionality that RMU has today:\n<ul>\n<li>Web GUI: The lack of a web interface should not be a problem given that most developers are using the Cloud Foundry CLI / IBM Cloud CLI to manage their applications.</li>\n<li>Set Node.js log level on the fly: The developer needs to implement this functionality in their application – for example, loading log configuration periodically from file to pick up a new log level configuration when the application is running. There are quite a few Node.js logging modules that Node.js developers are using so this capability is redundant to those options.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>What is the timeline?</b>\n<ul>\n<li>On February 26, 2018, we will stop updating RMU in public, dedicated, and local environments.</li>\n<li>On March 26, 2018, we will remove the RMU function from console in our public regions.</li>\n<li>Beginning April 9, 2018, we will start to remove the RMU function in dedicated and local environments.

Along with the name change, we’re also introducing an improved experience with a new pricing plan.\n<br><br>\nOur new name reflects our objective to provide broader and deeper capabilities for app developers that need to easily add user authentication to mobile and web apps and to authorize access to protected back-end resources running on Bluemix. We are also simplifying the experience of configuring and using the service, with new SDKs, APIs, and a redesigned console. If you are already using IBM Mobile Client Access for social login, you will be able to use IBM Bluemix App ID by provisioning and configuring a new IBM Bluemix App ID instance, replacing existing SDKs, and making the necessary changes to your code. Stay tuned for detailed how to information\n<br><br>\nWe will also release a single-tiered pricing plan for IBM Bluemix App ID that is based on the number of application users and the number of authentications. Giving weight to both volume and frequency better reflects the value that the App ID service provides. It also simplifies adoption for both business-to-consumer (B2C) apps and business-to-employee (B2E) apps. The current pricing plans, Gold and Bronze, will be retired. If you already have instances of the IBM Mobile Client Access service provisioned with the Gold and Bronze plans, those plans will be available for 12 months. However, you will need to update your application to use the IBM Bluemix App ID service during that time. We hope you will enjoy using the App ID service.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note</b>: An updated pricing plan and effective dates will be provided as that information becomes available.

There will be new API endpoints and a depreciation of old ones in the next few months. Second, we want to update you on the best way to leverage the HTTPS API, and notify you about the removal of non-secure access to the API. Keep reading for more details.\n<br><br>\n<b>Replication API Change</b><br>\nCloudant has built an improved replicator for better performing and is scalable. Replication leverages connection pooling and a new replication scheduler. It allows for running a large number of replications concurrently without overwhelming a Cloudant environment. There are new API endpoints, /_scheduler/docs and /_scheduler/jobs, and more descriptive replication states to provide enhanced transparency to replication job status.\n<br><br>\nOne important note is that the new replicator will not update replication docs with transient states. Thus, if you are leveraging this function programmatically, then you will need to update your code to use the new /_scheduler/docsAPI. The new replicator will be rolling out across Cloudant environments in the coming weeks. We will maintain a compatibility mode for a minimum of the next 90 days to enable you to update your applications. For more details on the new API and changes, see the <u><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/replicator-apache-couchdb-cloudant/\" target=\"_blank\">A new replicator for Apache CouchDB & IBM Cloudant</a></u> article.\n<br><br>\n<b>Cloudant Requires HTTPS</b><br>\nThe Cloudant API has supported both HTTP and HTTPS for some time. We want to ensure that you leverage the API in the most secure way possible and avoid sending unencrypted credentials. Therefore, beginning in a minimum of 30 days from the release of the blog post (June 27, 2017), the Cloudant team will update environments to cease supporting HTTP connections, and continue support for HTTPS only. You should update your applications accordingly to ensure that you do not have an outage using the API. Additionally, if you have active replications using HTTP, will need to restart them using HTTPs. This action will result in a full restart of the replication from sequence 0.\n<br><br>\n<b>Cloudant Recommends TLS 1.2</b><br>\nThe IBM Cloudant team recommends that all customers to use TLS 1.2. While Cloudant has supported TLS 1.0 and 1.1 previously and will continue to do so for some time, moving to TLS 1.2 simply ensures that you have a more secure connection. We strongly recommend that you update to the most current version of your client software and use security settings to ensure that only TLS 1.2 is used.\n<br><br>\nThis information originated in the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/06/announcing-upcoming-changes-best-practices-ibm-cloudant-replication-security/\" target=\"_blank\">Announcing Upcoming Changes and Best Practices for IBM Cloudant Replication and Security</a></u> article within the Bluemix blog.","category":"SERVICES","subCategory":"cloudoe.sop.enum.paratureCategory.literal.l119","regionsAffected":[{"id":"AU-SYD"},{"id":"EU-DE"},{"id":"EU-GB"},{"id":"US-SOUTH"}],"url":"","archived":false,"eventTime":{"start":"2017-06-28T20:00:15.526Z","end":""},"creation":{"time":"2017-06-28T21:13:49.888Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"},"alerts":"","lastUpdate":{"time":"2017-06-28T21:13:49.888Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"}}},

This service enables application owners and developers to control the release of features to mobile applications. It provides the following features:\n<ul>\n<li>Feature Toggle: Use a control switch to turn features on and off. You can turn off poorly performing features or turn on a feature only to opted-in users, beta testers, or users that qualify with certain criteria.</li>\n<li>Gradual Release: Mitigate risk by releasing features with a staged roll out approach. Gain confidence by experimentation. For example, define key performance indicator for a feature (KPI), turn the feature on to a limited percentage of the user base and for a limited time. Based on real-time feedback, you can decide to turn the feature on to the entire user base or just switch the feature off if results are unsatisfactory.</li>\n<li>Test feature / user interface variants (A/B Tests): Go beyond in-house testing. Get end-user feedback on your application variants and make informed decisions based on the observed behavior.</li>\n<li>Customize an application to target user groups: Adapt application behavior or an application user interface to users based on geographic, contextual, and behavioral aspects without having to make an application store update. For example, you can change the application appearance and content based on user location to support local events and holidays.</li>\n<li>Send in-app updates to end users: Send messages to application users during the application usage.

The following changes will become effective as of March 1, 2018:\n<ul>\n<li>Retire the existing Developer, Developer Pro and Professional per Capacity pricing plans<br>\nWe are retiring the existing Developer, Developer Pro and Professional per Capacity plans with their related Gb-hour metric in favor of a simpler plan with a simpler metric. Existing Mobile Foundation instances using these pricing plans will continue to be available and supported for a period of 1 year until the End of Support on February 28, 2019. However, your clients must migrate existing instances to a newer pricing plan by the End of support date. All instances that are still provisioned using the older pricing plans as of the End of Support date will be deleted.</li>\n<li>Introduce a new Developer Plan<br>\nWe are introducing a Developer plan based on a simpler metric. For example, Daily client device. This plan provisions a Mobile Foundation server as a Bluemix Cloud Foundry application on Liberty for Java. Liberty for Java is billed separately and not included in this plan. Note: This plan does not support the use of external databases and is restricted to development and test only. Each instance is limited to 10 Daily client devices.</li>\n<li>Introduce a new Professional per Device plan<br>\nWe are introducing a new plan that allows you to easily estimate your pricing at $0.05 per Daily client device. You are charged only for the number of devices that connect per day. Each instance is limited to 1 app only for unlimited number of devices. You may use the app for any use case B2C, B2E or B2B. You are charged the same per Daily client device regardless of whether you use the app for development, test, staging or production. This plan requires that you to have a DB2 on Cloud service instance, which is created and billed separately. Liberty for Java is billed separately and not included in this plan. Optionally, you can add the Mobile Analytics service instance. The Mobile Analytics service is billed separately.</li>\n<li>Introduce a lower price for the Professional 1 Application plan<br>\nMany clients like the predictability of this pricing plan for unlimited number of devices regardless of whether they use the app for development, test, staging or production. We are pleased to announce that we are making this plan even more attractive by lowering the monthly price from $5,000/Instance to $3,000/Instance.</li>\n</ul>\nThis information originated in the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/01/ibm-mobile-foundation-pricing-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Mobile Foundation Pricing Updates</a></u> article within the IBM Cloud platform blog.","category":"SERVICES","subCategory":"cloudoe.sop.enum.paratureCategory.literal.l323","regionsAffected":[{"id":"AU-SYD"},{"id":"EU-DE"},{"id":"EU-GB"},{"id":"US-SOUTH"}],"url":"","archived":false,"alerts":"","eventTime":{"start":"2018-01-31T20:07:59.968Z","end":""},"creation":{"time":"2018-01-31T20:34:21.696Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"},"lastUpdate":{"time":"2018-01-31T20:38:09.964Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"}}},

IBM Key Protect manages the entire life-cycle of keys from key creation through application use, key archival, and key destruction, while also enforcing the separation of duties between data management and key management. IBM Key Protect supports Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) customer-managed encryption, which allows you to import master root-of-trust encryption keys into IBM Key Protect. These encryption keys are created within an internal, on-premise key management service (KMS). Using a process called envelope encryption, BYOK gives organizations the ability to have more control over the security of the data stored in the IBM Cloud.\n<br><br>\nIBM Key Protect provides the following capabilities:\n<ul>\n<li>Allows any customer encryption enabled data-as-a-service or internal applications to use REST APIs for integrating encryption capabilities with IBM Key Protect. It eliminates the need to spend the time or effort building proprietary (and often insecure) solutions to protect encryption keys.</li>\n<li>Meets all compliance requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>\n<li>Supports BYOK customer-managed encryption.</li>\n<li>Provides the ability to delete keys without any residual copies remaining.

In line with this fundamental concept, we have just released a major innovation for IBM Cloud <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/virtual-servers\" target=\"_blank\">virtual server instances (VSI)</a></u>. In select data centers, we are now offering VSIs that support more granular billing and the ability to suspend billing altogether when you power them off.\n<br><br>\nThere are a number of different reasons that customers have been asking for this capability. Sure, you can just terminate your instance and spin up a new one when you need it. But the process of reprovisioning and reconfiguring settings can be impractical for routine use. As a result, many users choose to leave <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/virtual-servers/details\" target=\"_blank\">VSIs</a></u> running even when they know that the time spent on running their actual workloads is likely to be minimal.\n<br><br>\nTo address this situation, we came up with a way to simplify the process. We ended up taking a different approach than our competitors, and our implementation offers significant advantages.\n<br><br>\n<b>How Does the Suspend Billing Feature Work?</b><br>\nWhen you shut down a VSI that supports the suspend billing feature, we will stop billing for the following items that are associated with that instance:\n<ul>\n<li>CPU cores\n<li>RAM\n<li>Port speed\n<li>Operating system licensing costs\n<li>Monitoring add-ons\n</ul>\nNote: Any attached persistent storage, 100 GB primary volume upgrades, and secondary IPs will continue to incur charges\n<br><br>\nWhile we suspend billing we do not deallocate your instance from its host. While you are powered off, we make the host resources available for <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/02/transient-virtual-servers/\" target=\"_blank\">transient instances</a></u> Transient Instances. However, we remove those temporary guests when you turn your VSI back on. It means that your time to resume is fast, and from the perspective of the VSI, it is a simple boot after a power-off. When you power your VSI back on, you can expect to have it fully accessible within approximately 2 minutes, and potentially as quickly as 30 seconds depending on your operating system. In general, the time to have your VSI accessible again will be at least twice as fast as having provisioned it from scratch.\n<br><br>\nAnother advantage of this new feature is that all of these events are measured based on the minute; not the hour.

Now that this effort is complete, the Runtimes team has been able to deprecate the proprietary IBM SDK for Node.js in favor of the community builds. For more information, see <u><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/node/sdk/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM SDK for Node.js Overview</a></u>. Starting with our next release, the IBM Node.js buildpack on <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Cloud</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Cloud Private</a></u> will provide the community edition binaries as a default.\n<br><br>\n<b>What does this change mean for you?</b><br>\nThis change reduces the delay between community releases and IBM buildpack releases so that you can enjoy the latest and greatest release right away on IBM Cloud. Additionally, it means that the IBM Runtimes team can focus on increasing our contributions to the test efforts for the community version and also work on new features for all Node developers. To learn more, refer to this <u><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/node/2018/04/25/going-open-deprecating-the-ibm-sdk-for-node-js-in-favour-of-the-community-builds/\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js @ IBM</a></u> blog post. IBM will continue to provide the same level of support as we have previously for the buildpack and Node.js versions available through IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Private.\n<br><br>\nDeprecation of OpenSSL FIPS module<br>\nWith this shift, the Node.js buildpack will include features that are available through the community runtime binaries. For users of our Node.js OpenSSL FIPS module, this change means that, in alignment with the community, the current OpenSSL FIPS module in the buildpack will not be updated. The current OpenSSL FIPS module and the latest IBM SDK for Node.js Version 8 (equivalent to Node.js 8.9.4) will be available in the buildpack for 30 days and will be eligible for removal as of August 24, 2018. However, be aware that the OpenSSL FIPS module in the Node.js FIPS build is derived from a code base that is now nearing end of life and has not received any security updates.\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, the FIPS module, itself, is not supported by the OpenSSL community. You can find more information about OpenSSL and FIPS in the <u><a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/05/18/new-lts/\" target=\"_blank\">LTS release</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/01/18/f2f-london/\" target=\"_blank\">Crypto policy</a></u> Open SSL blog posts. As a result, if you want to continue to use FIPS, we encourage you to make alternative arrangements with the OpenSSL community.\n<br><br>\nSupport for Node.js<br>\nIBM support for Node.js releases ends in line with LTS in the community. The Node.js versions that are included with the IBM Node.js buildpack will be updated accordingly, including the removal of Node 4.x after August 24, 2018. Here are the applicable dates:\n<ul>\n<li>Node 4.x – Ended April 2018</li>\n<li>Node 6.x – Ends April 2019</li>\n<li>Node 8.x – Ends December 2019</li>\n</ul>\nNode.js is a trademark of Joyent, Inc. and is used with permission.

This plan is primarily intended for small scale projects and prototypes that do not demand high performance, which is available with higher tier plans.</li>\n<li><b>Current Standard Plan will become Advanced Plan</b>: While maintaining similar capabilities as the current Standard Plan, the Advanced Plan will offer reserved storage and other performance benefits and begins at only $1000/month.</li>\n</ul>\nThere are no changes to the custom model pricing.

The restarts will be staggered to minimize the overall impact to Bluemix users. However, while the maintenance is going on, you may experience several windows during which Bluemix login and application management functions (stage/start/stop, etc.) are unavailable, and running applications may be temporarily unreachable. In addition, every application will be automatically restarted at least once. \n<br/><br/>\nIn addition, many of the Services that Bluemix applications are bound to will also be temporarily unavailable, as their data center servers are also restarted. Most of these Services restarts will take place during the same maintenance windows listed above, however some Services may be affected at times outside these windows. Additional information on the affected Services will be provided in an update prior to the start of this maintenance.\n<br/><br/>\nFor the US-SOUTH region, the main windows will be:<br/>\n* October 24 06:00 UTC for approximately 5 hours<br/>\n* October 24 15:00 UTC for approximately 5 hours<br/>\n* October 25 04:00 UTC for approximately 5 hours\n<br/><br/>\nFor the EU-GB region, the main window will be:<br/>\n* October 26 23:00 UTC for approximately 5 hours\n<br/><br/>\nThe duration of each interruption may be less than the full maintenance window however, we strongly suggest to take advantage of multi-region deployment of critical apps, where applicable, to minimize the disruption to your applications.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Bluemix Operations team will closely monitor the progress and provide updates via the status page as necessary.\n<br/><br/>\nPlease continue to monitor the status page at http://ibm.biz/bluemixstatus for ongoing communication and updates regarding this very important service action.","category":"PLATFORM","subCategory":"cloudoe.sop.enum.paratureCategory.literal.l133","regionsAffected":[{"id":"EU-GB"},{"id":"US-SOUTH"}],"url":"","archived":true,"alerts":"","eventTime":{"start":"2015-10-23T14:00:00.000Z","end":"2015-10-28T03:00:00.000Z"},"creation":{"time":"2015-10-22T16:15:21.217Z","email":"dpj_local@us.ibm.com"},"lastUpdate":{"time":"2015-10-23T21:55:15.299Z","email":"dpj_local@us.ibm.com"}}},

The restarts will be staggered to minimize the overall impact to Bluemix users. However, while the maintenance is going on, you might experience several windows during which the following situations might occur:\n<ul>\n<li>Bluemix login and application management functions, such as staging, starting, stopping, and Services might be unavailable.</li>\n<li>Running applications might be temporarily unreachable.</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition, every application will be automatically restarted at least once. \n<br/><br/>\nMany of the services that Bluemix applications are bound to will also be temporarily unavailable as their data center servers are also restarted. Most of these service restarts will take place during the same maintenance windows listed below. However, some services might be affected at times outside these windows by other data center dependencies. \n<br/><br/>\n\nFor the US-SOUTH region, the main windows will be:\n<ul>\n<li>July 20th, 05:00 - 08:30 UTC</li>\n<li>July 24th, 05:00 - 08:30 UTC</li>\n<li>July 25th, 05:00 - 11:30 UTC</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nFor the EU-GB region, the main window will be:\n<ul>\n<li>July 24th, 23:00 UTC - July 25th, 02:30 UTC</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nFor the AU-SYD region, the main window will be:\n<ul>\n<li>July 24th, 14:00 - 16:00 UTC</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nIf you have a Dedicated Bluemix region, consult with your IBM Advocate for maintenance schedule details for that region.\n<br/><br/>\nThe duration of each interruption might be less than the full maintenance window. However, we strongly suggest that you take advantage of multi-region deployment of critical applications, where applicable, to minimize the disruption to your production applications.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Bluemix and Services Operation team will take all reasonable steps to minimize the disruption.

This announcement is to advise you that we will be closing the AppScan Dynamic Analyzer service and we will provide its capabilities as part of the new Application Security on Cloud service.\n\nThe deprecation will result in the following changes:\n- The service tile will be removed from the Bluemix catalog on or after Tuesday, February 11, 2016, which is the deprecation date for this service. You will not be able to provision new instances of the service after this date.\n- For a period of 60 days thereafter, until approximately April 11th (end-of-service date), all existing provisioned instances of the service will continue to be available to you through your Bluemix dashboard. These existing instances will continue to be supported by IBM. However, you will not be able to create new scans with these services.\n- Any instance of the service still provisioned as of the end-of-service date, as well as any reports left on the service, will be deleted by IBM.\n\nIt is requested that you unprovision your instances of this service before the end-of-service date. Prior to unprovisioning the services or allowing it to be deleted, you should export your data from the AppScan Dynamic Analyzer service.\n\nWe encourage you to migrate to the Application Security on Cloud service.\n\nWe’re here to help!

In addition, every application will be automatically restarted at least once. \n<br/><br/>\nMany of the Services that Bluemix applications are bound to, will also be temporarily unavailable, as their data center servers are also restarted.

The domain used on the messaging certificate is *messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com. The Watson IoT Platform has a certificate signed by a reputable certificate authority, so you can trust that you are connecting to the genuine Watson IoT Platform.

Having this option enables IT administrators to rest a little easier knowing that they are protecting their company’s network and workloads while keeping access flexible and easy.\n<br><br>\n<b>How does it work?</b><br>\nThe account owner can enable MFA in their IBM Cloud account using these steps:\n<ol>\n<li>Click <b>Manage > Security > Identity and Access</b> in the IBM Cloud Console.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Settings</b> under the <b>Identity & Access</b> menu on the left side to see the authentication options for the account.</li>\n</ol>\nAfter you enable multi-factor authentication for the account, users that log into the account will be asked to install an authentication application like Google Authenticator or IBM Verify.

An enhanced version of the service has been released as a Beta to introduce some exciting new features.\n<br><br>\nThe Beta version of the service runs on a Kubernetes container-based infrastructure and provides several new functional enhancements. The beta is accessed through two new service plans that have been added to the existing set of GA service plans that are available for Streaming Analytics. If you choose the <b>Beta – Entry</b> or <b>Beta – Enhanced</b> plan when you create your Streaming Analytics service, a Streaming Analyics Beta instance will be provisioned for you, It will give you access to the following new features and behavior:\n<ul>\n<li>Streaming Analytics running on a container-based infrastructure<br>\nContainers provide security and availability advantages to Streaming Analytics. They enable Streams compute resources to be dynamically allocated/returned as-needed when you are running your Streams applications.</li>\n<li>Guaranteed tuple processing<br>\nThe IBM Streams concept of consistent regions is now supported in the IBM Cloud. All Beta instances have a check-pointing repository pre-configured to support consistent regions. To learn how to exploit consistent regions in your Streams apps, see <u><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/2015/02/20/processing-tuples-least-infosphere-streams-consistent-regions/\" target=\"_blank\">Guaranteed tuple processing in Streams v4 with consistent regions</a></u>.</li>\n<li>Operating system upgrade<br>\nStreams instances that are created through the Beta plans will run in CentOS 7.4 environments.</li>\n<li>Identity & Access Management<br>\nThe Beta adds IBM Cloud Identity & Access Management to the Streaming Analytics service. It enables you to securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources consistently throughout IBM Cloud.</li>\n<li>Enhanced Streaming Analytics REST API<br>\nThe Beta introduces version 2 of the Streaming Analytics REST API, which follows the structure and conventions consistent other IBM Cloud APIs.</li>\n<li>Problem determination enhancements in the Streams Console<br>\nFor a description of these enhancements, see the  <u><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/2018/02/15/streaming-analytics-console-gives-ways-find-fix-errors-beta-plans/\" target=\"_blank\">New problem determination features in the beta version of the Streaming Analytics service</a></u> article.</li>\n<li>Enhanced performance monitoring from the Streams Console<br>\nFor a description of these new capabilities, see the <u><a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/2018/02/15/monitor-operators-behave-ensure-resource-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\">Monitoring how operators behave and guaranteed tuple processing in the cloud</a></u> article.</li>\n<li>Integration with Activity Tracker<br>\nThe Beta integrates Activity Tracker with the Streaming Analytics service. <u><a href=\"https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/activity-tracker\" target=\"_blank\">Activity Tracker</a></u> is an IBM Cloud service that records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in the IBM Cloud.

These new versions will address potential security vulnerabilities in Redis. We recommend that you upgrade to these versions as soon as possible. In future weeks, we will be looking to move deployments with older versions onto these new versions.\n<br><br>\n<b>Background</b><br>\nRedis includes a powerful Lua scripting feature, which was introduced in Redis 2.6 in 2013. It had a number of extensions added to it - cmsgpack and struct - to make life easier for Lua script writers. Apple recently informed the creator of Redis that there were issues with these extensions which, when abused, might cause the server to corrupt the memory and crash or potentially take control of the Redis process. An <u><a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/119\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a></u> was made that there were new, patched versions of Redis available, which fixed these vulnerabilities.\n<br><br>\n<b>Exposure</b><br>\nFor a third-party attacker to exploit this vulnerability, they would require access to the Redis instance. At IBM, all of our Redis deployments are password protected and you can control access through a whitelist. Furthermore, we now have TLS/SSL connection support to protect against the interception of traffic by a third party.\n<br><br>\n<b>Action</b><br>\nWe consider the risk to Compose service deployments low due to these mitigations and the lack of any known exploitation of the vulnerabilities in the five years they have been available. We do, though, consider it important that you upgrade your Redis deployments as soon as possible to ensure that you are not running an exposed version of Redis.\n<ul>\n<li>Users of Redis 3.x should upgrade to Redis 3.2.12 or Redis 4.0.10</li>\n<li>Users of Redis 4.x should upgrade to Redis 4.0.10</li>\n</ul>\nAs an update is not available for older 2.x versions of Redis, we are moving to end-of-life 2.x Redis on the Compose platform.\n<br><br>\nAlso, Redis 4.0.10 has become the preferred version of Redis for new deployments. If you automate deployments and do not override the default version, you should allow for this version in your processes.\n<br><br>\n<b>Future Action</b><br>\nIf you do not upgrade your deployments before the middle of July 2018, you should expect automated upgrades to take place on your deployment at some point after that time as part of regular maintenance work.

We are excited to announce two major changes to the pricing of the service that will help reduce the cost for our developers.\n<ol>\n<li>Remove add-on price for Speech to Text Narrowband Model<br>\nUntil now, if you were to use the Narrowband model, the price for the add-on was $.02/per minute of transmitted audio. Along with the base price of $.02/per minute of transmitted audio, the total per minute cost to you was $.04 / per minute of transmitted audio. Starting July 2017, we will be removing this add-on charge! Thus, the total charge for using the Narrowband model will be $.02 / per minute of transmitted audio. Also, IBM Watson does not round the usage for every API call. If you submit two 30 seconds segments of audio, your total charge would be $.02.</li>\n<li>Provide graduated tiered pricing<br>\nWe also want to pass along additional discounts to high-volume customers. Starting July 2017, we will be adding a graduated tiered pricing for using Speech to Text API.

At the time, we announced the partnership with our shared vision to deliver cloud native and integrated “as a Service” capabilities and eliminate the need to manage multiple costly, third-party vendors.\n<br><br>\n<b>Cloud Internet Services Standard Plan, offered on the IBM Cloud</b><br>\nYou need to deliver fast, secure, mobile, and always-on applications that optimizes end-user experiences to maximize their business outcomes. To equip our customers to be competitive, it was critical for IBM to integrate Cloudflare’s capabilities with our cloud to deliver IBM Cloud Internet Services. With this partnership, our clients can expect truly differentiated services and capabilities.\nThe Cloud Internet Services Standard GA release provides the same core features that were part of the EAP, including DNS, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection, Global Load Balancing (GLB) with geo-steering, caching with Page Rules, TLS/SSL Certificate, and a Web Application Firewall (WAF). With this new release, we’ve introduced the following changes:\n<ul>\n<li>Improved on/off WAF configuration.</li>\n<li>Improved monitoring metrics to provide greater insights. It is available through a simple pricing model of $275 per domain per month.</li>\n<li>A <u><a href=\"https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/internet-services\" target=\"_blank\">cost-free 30-day Cloud Internet Services trial</a></u> for one domain. This option will let you try all the Standard Plan GA features. Best of all, this solution can be leveraged using a single UI (in the IBM Cloud Console), CLI, and API for greater ease of use.</li>\n</ul>\nFor more details about how to get started using this new service, you can access our <u><a href=\"https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/cis/getting-started.html#getting-started-with-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis-\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a></u> and check out our <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJqkBVogMvk&t=3s\" target=\"_blank\">video</a></u>.\n<br><br>\n<b>Note</b>: IBM Cloud Internet Services Standard is now generally available.

Whether you want to find answers, surface patterns, or monitor trends, Watson Discovery allows you to quickly extract the most relevant information from your own data.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is changing with Discovery pricing?</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple and Predictable Advanced Plan: The Advanced Plan will be based on document tiers with a simple price calculation (no more document hours!). This change means that your monthly bill will not fluctuate based on the number of documents unless you are switching between tiers. Moreover, we have value-priced our tiers with very generous document allowances, which enable you to analyze more data at a significantly lower price.</li>\n<li>Retirement of the Standard Plan: Standard Plans will not be available to new users. If you are using an existing standard plan, you can continue to use it or upgrade to our Advanced Plan, which combines value with seamless scale.</li>\n<li>Lower Lite Plan Limits: Keeping with the spirit of a free forever “try before buy” plan, the document and news query limits for the Lite Plan will be lowered to 1000 documents per month and 200 news queries per month. Your first custom model is still on us!</li>\n<li>Drastically Lower Premium Plan Pricing: If you are looking for data and compute isolation to meet higher information security requirements, <u><a href=\"https://ibm.biz/contact-wdc-premium\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a></u> about our Premium Plan. We have lowered the pricing significantly while keeping key features, such as single tenant deployment architecture, end-to-end encryption, higher plan volumes, guaranteed SLAs, and access to advanced product capabilities.</li>\n<li>Tiered Pricing for News Queries: If you are paying for news queries in the Advanced or Premium plans, we are introducing discounts for larger volumes on a tiered basis and lowering your current price.

If you have questions or concerns about Compose pricing on Bluemix, contact us at support@compose.com.\n<br><br>\nTo re-phrase Chicken Little, “The prices are falling, the prices are falling!” If you’re not familiar with <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/cloud-data-services/compose/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Compose</a></u>, it’s a fully-managed technology to run open source databases for applications.\n<br><br>\nStarting on or after September 1, 2017, all Compose services will be put into new pricing tiers. For example, <u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mongodb/\" target=\"_blank\">Compose for MongoDB</a></u> currently starts at $31 for the first GB of data plus an additional $18 per GB. Under the new pricing plan, MongoDB starts at $13 less; the first GB is $18 and each additional GB is another $18. Initial deployment costs are dropping for all of the other Compose services as well including:\n<ul>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-redis\" target=\"_blank\">Redis</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-elasticsearch\" target=\"_blank\">Elasticsearch</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-postgresql\" target=\"_blank\">PostgreSQL</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mysql\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-scylladb\" target=\"_blank\">SycllaDB</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-rethinkdb\" target=\"_blank\">RethinkDB</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-etcd\" target=\"_blank\">etcd</a></u></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-rabbitmq\" target=\"_blank\">RabbitMQ</a></u></li>\n</ul>\n\nJust as importantly, we’re also introducing new pricing tiers based on the data that is being consumed (or in the case of in-memory databases, such as Redis, the amount of RAM that is allocated). As you consume more data, the cost per unit will drop. For example, with MongoDB, there is a 10% reduction in cost per GB after your database crosses the 10GB threshold, and another 10% drop per unit at 25GB, and so forth. While the databases supported on IBM Compose are heterogeneous — NoSQL, SQL, JSON-based, wide column, in-memory, and so on — we have standardized on tiers that are applicable to all the databases. In memory databases, such as Redis, follow the same schedule of price drops per unit, but units are in MB, not GB.\n<br><br>\nIn short, every IBM Compose customer will see a drop in pricing next month.\n<br><br>\nWe changed to the new pricing because we wanted to double down on the Compose model of super simple pricing. Over time, other elements had complicated how we priced databases. But now, with a new model in place, there is a streamlined way to price deployments based on used RAM or storage, which also offers discounting at the higher levels of use.\n<br><br>\nHowever, we didn’t change our fundamentals: Compose databases are deployed the same as always in highly available and fully managed environments. Every Compose deployment features high availability, automatic failover, daily backups, auto-scaling resources, 24/7 monitoring and support, a robust set of APIs for managing your deployments remotely, SSH/SSL encryption, and more.\n<br><br>\nKeep an eye out for the upcoming price changes. The full schedule of changes and pricing tiers will be published when the pricing changes are made next month. \n<br><br>\nLearn about <u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=data\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Compose and other Data & Analytic services on Bluemix</a></u>.\n<br><br>\nThis information was originally published in the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/06/compose-price-drop/\" target=\"_blank\">Compose Price Drop</a></u> article on the Bluemix blog.\n<br><br>\n<b>September 12, 2017 update:</b> For additional information, see: <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/09/new-pricing-incentives-compose-bluemix/\" target=\"_blank\">New Pricing and Incentives for Compose on Bluemix</a></u>","category":"PLATFORM","subCategory":"cloudoe.sop.enum.paratureCategory.literal.l133","regionsAffected":[{"id":"AU-SYD"},{"id":"EU-DE"},{"id":"EU-GB"},{"id":"US-SOUTH"}],"archived":false,"eventTime":{"start":"2017-08-23T16:00:00.000Z"},"creation":{"time":"2017-06-06T21:02:27.198Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"},"lastUpdate":{"time":"2017-09-14T14:41:59.155Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"}}},

It makes it easier for data engineers, data scientists, and developers to develop and deploy analytics applications. With integration through Jupyter notebooks in <u><a href=\"https://datascience.ibm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science Experience</a></u>, IBM Analytics Engine provides the foundation for executing data science and machine learning workloads. The IBM Analytics Engine utilizes the Hortonworks Data Platform as the underlying Hadoop distribution, which provides access to a market leading open source Hadoop distribution.\n<br><br>\nThe IBM Analytics Engine provides the ability to spin up clusters within minutes, easily scale clusters up, and supports external Hive metastores. To create and manage cluster lifecycles, administrators can use the Bluemix user interface, REST APIs, and the Cloud Foundry CLI. The latter two options enable programmatic access to operationalize the use of Hadoop and Spark from external applications while deploying data pipelines. Jobs can also be submitted through a Cloud Foundry CLI extension, which provides a nice scriptable way to execute jobs remotely. Also key is the capability to pass scripts to customize clusters at creation time, which enables a predictable configuration across cluster creation and deletion cycles.\n<br><br>\nThe architecture separates compute and storage for better scalability and reliability. It allows users to easily spin up clusters for the duration of a single job and delete them on completion. Users can execute jobs directly against data in the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/cloud-object-storage\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Cloud Object Storage</a></u> service and can make the analytic data even more resilient by using the cross-region option. The Analytics Engine leverages <u><a href=\"https://github.com/SparkTC/stocator\" target=\"_blank\">Stocator</a></u> when using Spark to improve data read and write speeds, thereby, delivering better performance on I/O intensive workloads.\n<br><br>\nWe believe that users should be focused on analyzing data instead of managing clusters and the intricacies of Hadoop or Spark platform configurations.

Also, the restoration of Elasticsearch 2.4.6 databases into new deployments will not be possible. However, backups can be restored into newer versions of Elasticsearch.</li>\n<li>Existing customers’ instances of Elasticsearch 2.4.6 will continue to run as normal until October 31, 2018. If you have an existing instance and need restoration or other deployment-related operations, you can request those operations by opening a Support case.</li>\n<li>If you want to upgrade at this time, you will have to use the restore-from-backup path to import your data into a new Elasticsearch 5.x deployment.</li>\n<li>The End of Support date is October 31, 2018.</li>\n<li>After October 31, 2018, all remaining Elasticsearch 2.4.6 installations will be required to upgrade to the current Elasticsearch 5.x release at the time.

Whether you want to find answers, surface patterns, or monitor trends, Watson Discovery allows you to extract the most relevant information from your own data. Additionally, Watson Discovery includes the world’s news enriched with natural language processing, which enables you to find insights from news and blog content for highly targeted search and trend analysis.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is changing with Watson Discovery?</b>\n<br>\nWatson Discovery offers an end-to-end cognitive data pipeline to ingest, enrich, and query data. The service uses advanced Natural Language Processing on ingested data to extract meta-data elements such as concepts, entities, keywords, sentiment, emotion, and more. We are updating the underlying NLP micro-service to use enrichment powered by Watson Natural Language Understanding service (NLU) instead of the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/03/bye-bye-alchemyapi/\" target=\"_blank\">retired</a></u> AlchemyAPI service. While the actual enrichment capabilities are not significantly different, the schema and configuration have changed, which impact the data that is used with Watson Discovery including Watson Discovery News. In addition to the Natural Language Processing changes, we have updated our news back-end that further improves the quality of the news results from Watson Discovery News. The new and improved news is available as a separate collection that you can query independently. You will find richer news results with better indexing of the most relevant article content with the new collection.\n<br><br>\n<b>When is it changing?</b>\n<ul>\n<li>The new Natural Language Processing micro-service with Natural Language Understanding is available today alongside the AlchemyLanguage Natural Language Processing micro-service. The AlchemyLanguage Natural Language Processing micro-service within Watson Discovery will be retired on Jan 15, 2018.</li>\n<li>The new Watson Discovery News collection is also available today alongside the original news collection for current users. The legacy news collection will be retired on Jan 15, 2018.</li>\n<li>All new Watson Discovery features will be developed with the new Natural Language Processing micro-service and new News collection going forward. Consequently, we recommend that you update your instance to use the new capabilities as early as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>What does this mean for you?</b>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have Watson Discovery collections using AlchemyLanguage enrichments, it is recommended that you re-ingest your data using the new Natural Language Processing enrichment as early as possible. See the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/discovery/migrate-nlu.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a></u> for more details on the schema changes. Note that with the recently announced <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/06/new-pricing-watson-discovery-service/\" target=\"_blank\">new pricing</a></u> for Watson Discovery, there is not an additional charge for enrichment overages.</li>\n<li>If you created a Watson Discovery Service instance prior to August 1, 2017, you will have access to two news collections (Original and New). We recommend that you update your news queries using the new Natural Language Processing schema and take advantage of the new News collection as early as possible. See the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/discovery/migrate-bwdn.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a></u> for more details.</li>\n<li>Because these changes support a single universal Natural Language Processing schema, you can now use the same queries across both the pre-enriched News collection as well as collections with your own data.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Where can I get more information?</b>\n<br>\nOur <u><a href=\"https://ibm.biz/wds_docs\" target=\"_blank\">documentation / release notes</a></u> provide detailed guidance on the service updates and migration steps.\n<br><br>\nThis information originated in the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/08/watson-discovery-service-updates-news-nlp/\" target=\"_blank\">Watson Discovery Service Updates for News and NLP</a></u> article on the Bluemix blog.","category":"SERVICES","subCategory":"cloudoe.sop.enum.paratureCategory.literal.l358","regionsAffected":[{"id":"AU-SYD"},{"id":"EU-GB"},{"id":"US-SOUTH"}],"archived":false,"eventTime":{"start":"2017-08-16T21:34:19.477Z"},"creation":{"time":"2017-08-16T21:36:31.174Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"},"lastUpdate":{"time":"2017-08-16T21:36:31.174Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"}}},

Our existing Enterprise Plan is best for production blockchain applications. The new Starter Plan is great for getting started with development and testing proof of concept blockchain applications. With the addition of the starter, you can now develop a solution through its entire life-cycle, from proof-of-concept all the way to enterprise production.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is enterprise blockchain and the IBM Blockchain Platform?</b><br>\nBlockchain will change the way businesses are run. Blockchain’s ability to facilitate trust at scale, without intermediaries, is fundamentally transforming how businesses transact with one another. Trusted transactions can dramatically reduce dispute resolution time, cut costs, and add security to transactions. Using blockchain, institutions can achieve greater collective value than any institution alone. <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/platform/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Blockchain Platform</a></u> addresses these business needs and provides a platform for industry disruptors to continue to innovate.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is the Starter Plan?</b><br>\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan was created to remove the barriers to getting started with blockchain.

If you are using TLS 1.0, you must upgrade to 1.1 or higher before May 30, 2017. Support for TLS 1.0 will end on or after May 30, 2017.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is TLS?</b>\n<br>\n<u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\" target=\"_blank\">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a></u> is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. It is the most widely deployed security protocol used today and it is used for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network. TLS ensures that a connection to a remote endpoint is the intended endpoint through encryption and endpoint identity verification. The versions of TLS, to date, are TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.\n<br><br>\n<b>Which APIs are affected?</b>\n<br>\nAll HTTP based APIs are affected as listed in the <u><a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/reference/api.html#api_http\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP APIs</a></u> section of the Bluemix documentation. Messaging-based APIs over both HTTP and MQTT have already withdrawn support for TLS 1.0. If you have an application that is making use of these APIs, then determine which level of TLS that you are using. You need to ensure you are using TLS 1.1 or 1.2. TLS 1.0 (and previous SSL versions) will stop working on or after May 30, 2017.\n<br><br>\n<b>Why are we making this change?</b>\n<br>\nOver time, security protocols improve and older ones are found to have weaknesses. We want to ensure that you have a secure solution and that is why we’re withdrawing support for the older TLS version.\n<br><br>\n<b>References</b>\n<br>\n<u><a href=\"http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NIST 800-52 Rev1</a></u>provides additional information about the selection and usage of TLS versions.\n<br><br>\nThis information was originally published in the <u><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/04/watson-iot-platform-disabling-tls-1-0/\" target=\"_blank\">Watson IoT Platform disabling TLS 1.0</a></u> article on the Bluemix blog.","category":"SERVICES","subCategory":"cloudoe.sop.enum.paratureCategory.literal.l108","regionsAffected":[{"id":"AU-SYD"},{"id":"EU-DE"},{"id":"EU-GB"},{"id":"US-SOUTH"}],"archived":false,"eventTime":{"start":"2017-05-17T18:45:00.000Z"},"creation":{"time":"2017-05-17T19:00:27.513Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"},"lastUpdate":{"time":"2017-05-17T19:01:21.586Z","email":"wkwentw@us.ibm.com"}}}
