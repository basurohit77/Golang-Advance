# Example NATS app
In this example app you can find several different ways of instrumenting NATS functions using New Relic. In order to run the app, make sure the following assumptions are correct: 
* Your New Relic license key is available as an environment variable named `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
* A NATS server is running locally at the `nats.DefaultURL`
